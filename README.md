# LeanCondensed

This is the development repository for *formalised* condensed mathematics in Lean. The mathematical results are due to Dustin Clausen and Peter Scholze. 

## Code organisation

The Lean code is contained in the directory `LeanCondensed`. The subdirectory `Mathlib`Â contains code that is ready to be integrated in Mathlib (and has in many cases already been PR-ed), organised in such a way that the file names correspond to the ones in Mathlib. The other subdirectories contain more work-in-progress code.
