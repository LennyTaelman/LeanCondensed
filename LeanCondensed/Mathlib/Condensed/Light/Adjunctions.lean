# Adjunctions regarding categories of light condensed objects

This file shows that the forgetful functor from light condensed abelian groups to light condensed
sets has a left adjoint, called the free light condensed abelian group on a ligh condensed set.

TODO (Dagur):
* Add free light condensed modules over more general rings.
