# The functor from topological spaces to light condensed sets

We define the functor `topCatToLightCondensed : TopCat.{u} ⥤ CondensedSet.{u}`.

## Projects

* Prove that `topCatToLightCondensed` is faithful.
* Define sequential topological spaces.
* Prove that `topCatToLightCondensed` restricted to sequential spaces is fully faithful.
* Define the left adjoint of the restriction mentioned in the previous point.

Associate to a `u`-small topological space the corresponding light condensed set, given by
`yonedaPresheaf`.
